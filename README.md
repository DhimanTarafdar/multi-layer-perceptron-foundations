# Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) & Neural Network Foundations


What happens if we stack multiple linear layers without activation?
What kind of decision boundary does an MLP create?
What are the main components of a neural network?
What is the difference between input layer, hidden layer, and output layer?
What is forward propagation?
